# Licensing in this consolidated project

Due to the nature of this project, making heavy use of (modified) existing software,
there is no uniform licensing that we can make available.
In general, we want to make our modifications available under an as permissive as
possible license, and as such, we make them available under the CC0 license.

In each of the subdirectories you should find one or more files named `LICENSE`.
The terms in those files generally apply to the software contained within.
